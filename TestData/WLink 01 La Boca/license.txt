LICENSE RESTRICTIONS

1. You may not install the Software on a network, unless the Software is used on only one computer or a separate license ("Extra User License") is obtained for each additional computer on which the Software is used. However, you may install the Software on a network for the sole purpose of distribution to additional computers, provided you have an Extra User License for each additional computer. Contact Davis for clarification or information about Extra User Licenses.  You may make no more than a reasonable number of copies of the Software for your own use, subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, this Section.

3. You may not sublicense, rent, lease, or loan the Software, but you may transfer the Software, accompanying Davis hardware, and Documentation on a permanent basis provided you retain no copies of any of the Software or Documentation and the recipient agrees to the terms of this Agreement. If the Software is an update or has been updated, any transfer must include the most recent update and all prior versions.

TERMINATION  

This Agreement is effective until terminated.  Davis may terminate this Agreement at any time upon your breach of any of the provisions hereof.

You will be liable to Davis for all damages suffered as a result of that breach.  Except for the license granted herein and as expressly provided herein, the terms of this Agreement will survive termination.

CHANGED PRODUCT FEATURES AND TERMS 
Davis has the right at any time to change or discontinue any aspect or feature of the Software and/or services offered by Davis, including, without limitation, the content, the equipment needed for access, or use of the service, or the Software itself. Davis also has the right at any time to change or modify the terms and conditions applicable to use of the Software, or any part thereof, or to impose new conditions, including, without limitation, adding fees and charges for use for services that are currently free or adding or removing Data upload partners, including, but not limited to, CWOP, GLOBE and any others. Such changes, modifications, additions or deletions shall be effective immediately upon notice thereof, which may be given by any means including, without limitation, posting on www.DavisNet.com or any other Davis website, or by electronic or conventional mail, or by any other means. Any use of the Software or services by you after such notice shall be deemed to constitute acceptance of such changes, modifications, additions or deletions.
LIMITED WARRANTY

Davis warrants to the original end user of the Software that (a) the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the documentation provided by Davis, as modified by Davis from time-to-time (“Documentation”) for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of receipt and (b) any Davis hardware accompanying the Software will be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of receipt.  This warranty will be void if you breach this Agreement or if the Software has been modified, tampered with, or improperly used.

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
 
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, DAVIS DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE, WITH REGARD TO THE SOFTWARE, SERVICES, DOCUMENTATION, AND THE ACCOMPANYING HARDWARE.  DAVIS DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL OPERATE IN COMBINATION WITH HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, SYSTEMS OR DATA NOT PROVIDED BY DAVIS, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SPECIFIED IN THE DOCUMENTATION, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY  

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will Davis be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, or damages for business interruption or loss of profits, revenue, business, savings, data, information, use or cost of substitute procurement, incurred by you or any third party, whether in an action in contract or tort, even if Davis has been advised of the possibility of such damages or if such damages are foreseeable.  In no event will Davis’s liability for damages hereunder exceed the amounts actually paid by you to Davis for the Software and/or Davis hardware.  The parties acknowledge that the limitations of liability and the allocation of risk in this Agreement are an essential element of the bargain between the parties, without which Davis would not have entered into this Agreement.  Davis’s pricing reflects this allocation of risk and the limitation of liability specified herein.

WARRANTY SUPPORT

You must report to Davis, promptly in writing, any breach of the express warranties set forth above during the warranty period.  Your sole and exclusive remedies, and Davis’s entire liability, for such a reported breach will be to correct or provide a reasonable workaround for any errors that caused the breach of warranty, or if Davis is unable to make the Software operate as warranted, you will be entitled to terminate the Software license and recover the fees paid to Davis for the Software license.  Davis will have no obligations under the warranty provision set forth above if the breach of warranty is caused by abuse, misuse, alteration, neglect or accidental damage of the Software; the unauthorized repair, modification or installation of the Software; or the use or attempted use of non-Davis software or hardware in combination with the Software.  Replacement or repair of Software does not extend its warranty period beyond the original warranty expiration date.
