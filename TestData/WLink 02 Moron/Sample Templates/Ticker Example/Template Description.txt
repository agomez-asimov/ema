Davis Ticker Examples

The davisticker applet will scroll text across a box on a web page. The text can either 
be specified directly on the web page, or in a separate data file. In either case you can 
use weather tags to insert weather data into the message. 

You can also control the size, color, and speed of the scrolling text by using applet parameters.

This template shows two examples of the davisticker java applet and describes the 
parameters used by the applet. Below each davisticker example is the HTML source code used to
generate the ticker. This can be copied and pasted into your own web page.
